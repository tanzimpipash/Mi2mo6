    <h1>About Bill Gates</h1>
    <p>William Henry Gates III (born October 28, 1955) is an American business magnate, software developer, investor,
        author, and philanthropist. He is a co-founder of Microsoft Corporation, along with his late childhood friend
        Paul Allen.[4][5] During his career at Microsoft, Gates held the positions of chairman, chief executive officer
        (CEO), president and chief software architect, while also being the largest individual shareholder until May
        2014.[6] He is considered one of the best known entrepreneurs of the microcomputer revolution of the 1970s and
        1980s.

        Gates was born and raised in Seattle, Washington. In 1975, he and Allen founded Microsoft in Albuquerque, New
        Mexico. It became the world's largest personal computer software company.[7][a] Gates led the company as
        chairman and CEO until stepping down as CEO in January 2000, succeeded by Steve Ballmer, but he remained
        chairman of the board of directors and became chief software architect.[10] During the late 1990s, he was
        criticized for his business tactics, which have been considered anti-competitive. This opinion has been upheld
        by numerous court rulings.[11] In June 2008, Gates transitioned to a part-time role at Microsoft and full-time
        work at the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation, the private charitable foundation he and his wife, Melinda Gates,
        established in 2000.[12] He stepped down as chairman of the board of Microsoft in February 2014 and assumed a
        new post as technology adviser to support the newly appointed CEO Satya Nadella.[13] In March 2020, Gates left
        his board positions at Microsoft and Berkshire Hathaway to focus on his philanthropic efforts including climate
        change, global health and development, and education</p>
