    <h1>Jeff Bezos</h1>
    pJeffrey Preston Bezos (/ˈbeɪzoʊs/ BAY-zohss;[3] né Jorgensen; born January 12, 1964)[4] is an American business
    magnate, media proprietor, and investor. Bezos is the founder and executive chairman of Amazon, having previously
    served as chairman, president and CEO of the company.[a] With a net worth of more than $200 billion as of June 2021,
    he is the richest person in the world according to both Forbes and Bloomberg's Billionaires Index.[1]

    Born in Albuquerque and raised in Houston and later Miami, Bezos graduated from Princeton University in 1986. He
    holds a degree in electrical engineering and computer science. He worked on Wall Street in a variety of related
    fields from 1986 to early 1994. Bezos founded Amazon in late 1994, on a cross-country road trip from New York City
    to Seattle. The company began as an online bookstore and has since expanded to a wide variety of other e-commerce
    products and services, including video and audio streaming, cloud computing, and artificial intelligence. It is
    currently the world's largest online sales company, the largest Internet company by revenue, and the world's largest
    provider of virtual assistants[6] and cloud infrastructure services through its Amazon Web Services branch.

    Bezos founded the aerospace manufacturer and sub-orbital spaceflight services company Blue Origin in 2000. Blue
    Origin's New Shepard vehicle reached space in 2015, and afterwards successfully landed back on Earth. The company
    has upcoming plans to begin commercial suborbital human spaceflight.[7] He also purchased the major American
    newspaper The Washington Post in 2013 for $250 million, and manages many other investments through his venture
    capital firm, Bezos Expeditions.
