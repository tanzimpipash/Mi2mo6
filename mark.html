    <h1>Mark Zuckerberg</h1>
    <p>Mark Elliot Zuckerberg (/ˈzʌkərbɜːrɡ/; born May 14, 1984) is an American media magnate, internet entrepreneur,
        and philanthropist. He is known for co-founding Facebook, Inc. and serves as its chairman, chief executive
        officer, and controlling shareholder.[3][4] He also is a co-founder of the solar sail spacecraft development
        project Breakthrough Starshot and serves as one of its board members.[5]

        Born in White Plains, New York, Zuckerberg attended Harvard University, where he launched the Facebook social
        networking service from his dormitory room on February 4, 2004, with college roommates Eduardo Saverin, Andrew
        McCollum, Dustin Moskovitz, and Chris Hughes.[6] Originally launched to select college campuses, the site
        expanded rapidly and eventually beyond colleges, reaching one billion users by 2012. Zuckerberg took the company
        public in May 2012 with majority shares. In 2007, at age 23, he became the world's youngest self-made
        billionaire. As of July 2021, Zuckerberg's net worth is $132 billion,[1] making him the 5th-richest person in
        the world.[1]</p>
